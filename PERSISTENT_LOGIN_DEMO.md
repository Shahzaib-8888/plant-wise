# Persistent Login Implementation

## Overview
Your PlantWise app now has persistent login functionality! This means users will stay logged in even after closing and reopening the app.

## How it works

### 1. User Flow
- **First Time Users**: Splash → Onboarding → Sign In/Sign Up → Home
- **Returning Users (not logged in)**: Splash → Sign In → Home  
- **Logged In Users**: Splash → Home (skips onboarding and auth screens)

### 2. Implementation Details

#### AuthStorageService
- Stores login state using SharedPreferences
- Tracks: login status, user ID, email, name, and first launch status
- Automatically clears on logout

#### Updated Authentication Flow
- Sign In/Sign Up: Automatically saves login state
- Sign Out: Automatically clears login state
- Splash Screen: Checks login state and navigates appropriately

#### Router Protection
- Protected routes require authentication
- Automatic redirect to appropriate screen based on login state

### 3. Key Files Modified/Created

1. **lib/features/authentication/data/services/auth_storage_service.dart** (NEW)
   - Main service for persistent storage

2. **lib/features/authentication/presentation/providers/auth_provider.dart** (UPDATED)
   - Now saves/clears login state on authentication actions

3. **lib/features/splash/presentation/screens/splash_screen.dart** (UPDATED)
   - Checks login state and navigates accordingly

4. **lib/features/onboarding/presentation/screens/onboarding_screen.dart** (UPDATED)
   - Marks first launch as complete

5. **lib/config/routes/app_router.dart** (UPDATED)
   - Added authentication-based redirects

### 4. Usage
Simply run the app and:

1. **First Launch**: Go through onboarding and sign up/sign in
2. **Close App**: Completely close the application
3. **Reopen App**: The app will automatically take you to the home screen, skipping auth screens!

### 5. Testing Different Scenarios

To test different user states:

```dart
// To reset to first-time user (in debug mode)
await AuthStorageService.instance.clearAllData();

// To simulate logout
await AuthStorageService.instance.clearLoginState();

// To check current state
final isLoggedIn = await AuthStorageService.instance.isLoggedIn();
final isFirstLaunch = await AuthStorageService.instance.isFirstLaunch();
```

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: Users don't need to log in every time
- **Industry Standard**: Expected behavior for modern apps
- **Secure**: Only stores non-sensitive user info locally
- **Flexible**: Easy to extend with additional user preferences
