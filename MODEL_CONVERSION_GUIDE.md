# YOLOv8 to TensorFlow Lite Conversion Guide

## Current Status
âœ… **TensorFlow Lite Flutter Integration**: Enabled and ready
âœ… **YOLOv8 PyTorch Model**: Found at `D:\temp\development\flutter\model-plantwise\runs\detect\yolov8_custom_finetuned\weights\best.pt`
âœ… **29 Disease Classes**: Loaded in your Flutter app
âœ… **App Architecture**: Ready for real inference

## Issue: Python 3.13 Compatibility
Your Python 3.13.5 environment has dependency conflicts with some packages needed for TensorFlow Lite conversion.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 (Recommended)
1. Install Python 3.11 or 3.12 alongside your current Python
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv yolo_conversion
   yolo_conversion\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   pip install ultralytics
   ```

3. Run the conversion:
   ```python
   from ultralytics import YOLO
   model = YOLO(r'D:\temp\development\flutter\model-plantwise\runs\detect\yolov8_custom_finetuned\weights\best.pt')
   model.export(format='tflite', imgsz=640)
   ```

### Option 2: Use Online Conversion Services
1. **Google Colab** (Free): Upload your model and convert online
2. **Ultralytics HUB**: Official platform with conversion tools

### Option 3: Use Pre-converted Models
If you have access to the same training environment where the model was created, export it there.

### Option 4: Alternative ML Frameworks
Consider using **ONNX** format which has better cross-platform support:
```python
model.export(format='onnx', imgsz=640)
```
Then use ONNX Runtime for Flutter (though this requires additional setup).

## Once You Have the .tflite File

1. **Copy the file** to: `D:\temp\development\flutter\plantwise\assets\models\plant_disease_model.tflite`

2. **Your app will automatically**:
   - Detect the real model
   - Switch from simulation to real inference
   - Show actual model input/output shapes in logs
   - Provide real disease detection results

## Expected Log Output (with real model)
```
ðŸ“± Real TensorFlow Lite model loaded successfully!
ðŸ”§ Model input shape: [1, 3, 640, 640]
ðŸ”§ Model output shape: [1, 33, 8400]
âœ… Disease Detection Service initialized successfully
```

## Model Specifications
- **Format**: TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)
- **Input Size**: 640x640 pixels
- **Classes**: 29 plant diseases
- **Architecture**: YOLOv8 nano (lightweight for mobile)

## Testing Your Model
Once the .tflite file is in place:

1. **Run your Flutter app**
2. **Navigate to**: Home â†’ Camera Icon (Identify Plant)
3. **Take a photo** of any plant
4. **See real AI results** instead of simulation

The app will automatically detect and use your real model - no code changes needed!

## Troubleshooting

### Model Too Large?
If your .tflite file is >20MB, consider:
- Using INT8 quantization: `model.export(format='tflite', int8=True)`
- Using YOLOv8n (nano) instead of larger variants

### Inference Errors?
Check that your model:
- Was trained with the same class labels as your `assets/models/labels.txt`
- Uses the standard YOLOv8 output format
- Was exported with the correct input size (640x640)

Your app architecture is **100% ready** for the real model! ðŸš€
