# Authentication Fix Testing Guide

## What was fixed
Fixed the infinite loading issue after sign-in by synchronizing the two conflicting authentication systems:

1. **AuthNotifier (StateNotifier-based)** - Used by SignInScreen and other auth UI
2. **AuthStorageService** - Used by app router for navigation decisions

## Changes Made
1. **AuthNotifier sync**: Updated `AuthNotifier` to automatically sync with `AuthStorageService` when authentication state changes
2. **Comments screen fix**: Updated `CommentsScreen` to use the unified auth provider system
3. **Proper state management**: Ensured single source of truth for authentication state

## Testing Steps

### 1. Fresh App Launch
- Launch the app
- Should show splash screen, then navigate to onboarding/sign-in based on first launch status

### 2. Sign In Flow
- Enter valid credentials on sign-in screen
- After successful authentication:
  - Should show loading briefly
  - Should automatically navigate to home screen (no infinite loading)
  - Should stay logged in when app is restarted

### 3. Navigation Flow
- After sign-in, try navigating between different screens
- All authenticated screens should work properly
- Comments screen should show current user info correctly

### 4. Sign Out Flow
- Sign out from profile or settings
- Should clear authentication state
- Should navigate back to sign-in screen
- Should stay logged out when app is restarted

### 5. Expected Behavior
✅ **BEFORE**: Sign-in would succeed but UI would show infinite loading
✅ **AFTER**: Sign-in succeeds and immediately navigates to home screen

## Technical Details
- `AuthNotifier._init()` now syncs with `AuthStorageService` on state changes
- Router redirect logic now stays in sync with actual auth state
- Single source of truth for authentication across the app
